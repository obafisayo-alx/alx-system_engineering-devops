## Description

This repository contains solutions for the project "0x0E. Web stack debugging #1". The project focuses on debugging issues related to web stack configuration, particularly with Nginx setup. Two tasks are included, each with specific requirements and solutions.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Nginx likes port 80

In this task, the challenge is to identify and fix the issue preventing Nginx from listening on port 80. The solution involves debugging the Nginx configuration and writing a Bash script to automate the fix.

### Task 1: Make it sweet and short

Task 1 builds upon the previous task, requiring a shorter and more concise Bash script to achieve the same goal. The script should be limited to 5 lines and maintain the necessary functionality without using certain operators or executing the previous script.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Bash scripts must be executable and pass Shellcheck without any errors.
- Nginx must be running and listening on port 80 of all the server's active IPv4 IPs.
- Scripts must adhere to usual Bash script requirements.
- Usage of specific operators and commands is restricted as mentioned in the tasks.
- The repository must include a README.md file at the root of the folder.

## Usage

To use the provided scripts:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory.
3. Execute the Bash scripts as required.
