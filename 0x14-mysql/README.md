#### Tasks
Here's an overview of the tasks you'll be tackling in this project:

1. **Install MySQL**: Get MySQL installed on both web-01 and web-02 servers.
2. **Let us in!**: Create a MySQL user on both servers to allow access for verification.
3. **If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes**: Set up a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server.
4. **Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?**: Create a new user for the replica server and set up replication between web-01 and web-02.
5. **MySQL backup**: Write a Bash script to generate a MySQL dump and create a compressed archive out of it.
